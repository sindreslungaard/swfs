Explore the different tools below by expanding the details.

##### Extracter `./swfs [options] extract`
<details>
The extract tool dumps all png and binary files of the swf files in a directory.

| Argument  | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| input       | Path to the directory where the swf files are located |
| output         | Path to the directory you want the extracted files to be placed  |
| [workers] | Size of worker pool. Higher number will increase the concurrent use of swfdump and swfextract. Default is 2.

```bash
./swfs -input /swfdir -output /extracted -workers 2 extract
```
</details>

##### Bundler `./swfs [options] bundle`
<details>
The bundle tool replaces the extracted folders into individual  `.asset` files.

| Argument  | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| input         | Path to the directory where the extracted files are located |
| [workers] | Size of worker pool. Higher number will increase the concurrency of the program. Default is 5.|

```bash
./swfs -input ./extracted -workers 5 bundle
```

The `.asset` file structure:
```bash
## Content of .asset files are structured as key value pairs
## separated by "=\n". Multiple assets are separated with 
## double newline "\n\n". First line is always the format version.

version=
1


some_extracted_image.png=
ï¿½PNG...


some_extracted_binary.bin=
<xml>
    ....
</xml>
```

To parse `.asset` files, split on `\n\n`, then loop through each part. Split each part on `=\n` to get [0]filename and [1]filedata.
