```
</details>

##### Bundler
<details>
The bundle tool replaces the extracted folders into individual  `.asset` files.

| Argument  | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| input         | Path to the directory where the extracted files are located |
| [workers] | Size of worker pool. Higher number will increase the concurrency of the program. Default is 5.|

```bash
./bundle -input ./extracted -workers 5
```

The `.asset` file structure:
```bash
## Content of .asset files are structured as key value pairs
## separated by "=\n". Multiple assets are separated with 
## double newline "\n\n"

version=1 # Format version used, always first line

some_extracted_binary.bin=
<xml>
    ....
</xml>
```

To parse `.asset` files, split on `\n\n`, then loop through each part. Split each part on `=\n` to get [0]filename and [1]filedata.
